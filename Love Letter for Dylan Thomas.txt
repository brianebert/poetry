The Welsh poet got it wrong.
Yes, lightening forked, six stanzas strong,

exhorting rage, toward the night.
Why should we pick a losing fight?

Night, after all, created Man.
Diurnal rest, a time for clan

to cluster round life giving fire,
to gaze aloft as stars inspire.

Primary sensors, eyes by day
spied predators, found food and way

but night brought our horizons close
we lay in wait until sun rose.

As spectacle emerged from hide,
wonderment of mind turned tide

from what to eat and what to flee
to what the hell is this I see?

The answers far for simian reach:
then evolution’s spasm, breach,

bursting forth through primate eye,
consciousness's newborn cry,

humans’ birth of god and time,
histories in metered rhyme,

what we can and when we can’t,
where to hunt and when to plant.

Why brought god; to why add how
priesthoods formed, seized status, now

source wasn’t theirs, but we forgot
man’s birth was something stars had wrought.

Night made us human don't forget,
our fireside gaze at stars that let,

spinors, strings, cosmology,
DNA, rockets, democracy,

answer questions pedigreed,
when stars above sowed human seed.

Each answer spawns another turn,
of questions, hopefully we learn,

that answers serve us very briefly,
knowledge lays in questions chiefly.

Do not rage as if you know,
anything ‘bout where you go,

from one moment ’til the next,
its arrogant to become vexed.

Go gently into day or night,
make a point to see star light,

with newborn eyes drink every gaze,
allow yourself to be amazed.

There’s nothing lost to those who try,
who knows, the light may never die.
