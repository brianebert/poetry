A Carmel lass,
white strapless hourglass,
Serenity’s gaze
before tall glaze,
her eyes on groom
who’d taken room
within her heart
since freshman start
of adult life.

An Oregon boy
smiling with joy
before forest land
clung to her hand.
Through a glass darkly
bright future stands starkly;
brogue spoken at end:
he’s her husband
and she his wife
