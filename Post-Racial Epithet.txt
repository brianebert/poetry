The Final Four

An undefeated season lost, two days short of clipping net;
he took the bench and words were tossed, hot post-racial epithet.

Accept it yes, let’s mark a day when words flew colorblind,
forgive the words and witness yeah, it’s way past time we find

post-racial justice in our streets, no marks of cane excusing,
abuses of state power we meet, unevenly abusing

our disenfranchised.  We must see today he is “the other,”
tomorrow could be you or me, prejudicially smothered.

Forgive the player’s passions, forgive but don’t forget;
we’re in this game together and we’ll win it that way yet.
