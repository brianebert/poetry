The Tin Man’s Tale

Gentle gray eyes beneath the cap embroidered with someone else’s tourist memory
were the only pair among scores picking through the clothing box, to look and see

her curves with acquisitive desire, as his handsome mouth spread in broad smile
that separated prominent nose and chin.  He took her for his own, at least for a while.

He nestled her atop staples he’d collected, in the long blue mesh sack
that he’d unfurled with a flourish, like Munchkinland’s Coroner, upon his arrival back

at the technicolor world that sustains him.  She took her place among his necessities.
You may only paint a boat the black and white of the world he’d left, stepping in off the street.

Her hull conformed, but her decks, no, screaming, in search and rescue neon green.
At last he’d found her, she was saved.  And so was I because I’d seen

that I’m not in Kansas anymore, that life seeks more than bread and vegetables,
that any of us can follow the yellow brick road, that Oz is Great and Powerful.
